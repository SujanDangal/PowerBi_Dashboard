Road Accident Analysis and Visualization Project

Overview

The Road Accident Analysis and Visualization Project aims to provide insights into road accidents by leveraging data analysis and visualization tools. This project focuses on identifying patterns, trends, and potential causes of road accidents to help authorities and stakeholders make informed decisions to improve road safety.

Features

Data Cleaning: Preprocessing raw road accident data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions and relationships between variables.

Visualization Dashboards: Interactive dashboards created using tools like Power BI or Tableau to display key metrics and trends.

Predictive Analysis: Implementing machine learning models to predict accident-prone areas or factors contributing to accidents.

Geospatial Analysis: Mapping accident hotspots using tools like Python's Folium or GIS software.
